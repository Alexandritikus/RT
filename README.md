# RT - 42 (UNIT)
This is a team graphic project in school 42 (UNIT), where I took an active part. The aim of the project is to create ray tracer.

<img align = "center" src = "images/img_1.png" width = "100%"/>

### Requirements
- linux or macos
- installed minilibx
- libx11-dev and libxext-dev for linux
- framework OpenGL and framework AppKit for mac

### How does it work?
	git clone --recursive https://github.com/Alexandritikus/rt
	cd rt
	make
	./RT [resolution: hd or fhd]

<img align = "center" src = "images/img_2.png" width = "100%"/>

<img align = "center" src = "images/img_3.png" width = "100%"/>
